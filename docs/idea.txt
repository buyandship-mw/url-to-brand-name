A two prompt approach might be sufficient to deal with a lot of these cases.

Prompt 1: Evaluate if brand/IP can be extracted straight out of URL. (use gpt-4.1)

Is the brand/IP name ambiguous from this URL alone? Respond Yes or No.
URL: <URL>

YES -> Use current system (Firecrawl to scrape item name, gpt-4.1-mini to extract brand/IP from item name).

NO -> Prompt 2: Extract brand/IP right out of URL (use gpt-4.1)
Extract the best name to represent the brand/IP of this product.
"<URL>"

Respond in JSON: {"name": <value>} or {"error": "no brand"}
